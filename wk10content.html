    <li>Remember that: I'm giving you these comments because I have very high expectations and I know you can reach them. (David S. Yeager, 2013)</li>
    <li>Also remember that we are all on the figurative bus to the skills competition (job search) where, after completing 5.5 semesters, this is indeed where you belong and are able to say:<ol>
     <li>I belong in this academic community.</li>
     <li>My ability and competence grow with my effort.</li>
     <li>I can succeed at this.</li>
     <li>This work has value for me. </li>
     (Camille A. Farrington, 2012)</ol>
